# 🚀 Adaptive Ad Recommendation Engine with LinUCB & LLM Embeddings

This project implements a **contextual bandit–based ad recommender system** using the LinUCB algorithm, enhanced with **MiniLM sentence embeddings** for rich ad context. It is trained on a **real subset of the Criteo Click-Through Rate (CTR) dataset**, and deployed as an interactive dashboard via Streamlit.

## 📌 Key Features

- 🎯 **Reinforcement Learning (Contextual Bandits)** using LinUCB
- 🤖 **LLM-based embeddings** with `sentence-transformers (MiniLM)` for ad descriptions
- 📊 **CTR visualization** over 10K+ real user-ad interactions
- 🧠 Simulates user behavior using real Criteo click logs
- 🎮 Interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for testing ad recommendations in real-time
